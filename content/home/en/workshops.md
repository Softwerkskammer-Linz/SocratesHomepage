We will organize four workshops on Friday starting from 2pm until 6pm. 

Every attendee can submit a workshop. We will later have a voting and the four most popular workshops will take place. 
If your workshop gets accepted, you will have to buy a ticket.

The currently suggested workshops, which will be available for voting, are:
* "A guided hands on tour through Machine Learning and Data Science" - Martin Weber, Bernhard Niedermayer
   Machine Learning and Data Science are gaining more traction in private enterprises. Revenue forecasting and predictive maintenance are the guiding topics of what is called Retail and Industry 4.0. We will start with some very basic examples and guide the participants to state of the art machine learning approaches. The workshop will also contain hands on excercises for which we will provide an environment and appropriate data sets to allow everyone to participate. 

To submit a workshop, please send us the proposal (title, abstract, lecturers) to [info@socrates-conference.at](mailto:info@socrates-conference.at).
