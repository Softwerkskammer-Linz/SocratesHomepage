We will organize the SoCraTes Day Linz as an "Open Space". This is an "unconference" format designed to maximize learning and sharing among participants. Be prepared to be surprised!

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">"Open Space Technology"</a> is a meeting format where every participant takes part in defining the agenda and the schedule. Everyone can propose to give a talk or workshop or to start a discussion group. Or you can ask to learn more about a topic and maybe you'll find someone who will host a session about it together with you. Then we'll all work together to find a time slot and a room for you, and you are ready to go.

So: You decide, together with your peers, what you can learn on this day. Make the most of it!

<h3>Basic Structure</h3>

In the morning, we will come together and plan the day. Everyone can propose sessions: Think of something you want to teach or learn, write it on a
big sticky note, present it briefly to the audience, and find a free time-slot. That's it, now you'll host a session at the conference!

Here are some examples of sessions you could propose to the audience:

* I have been playing around with the new features of Spring Boot for some time and I want to show them to you. Together we can put together a little example application.
* I have this presentation about /topic/ I gave at /another conference/, maybe you are interested in it.
* I wrote some cool code in my spare time. I want to show you what technologies I used and how I solved this interesting problem. I would also welcome any input or suggestions.
* I want to learn more about monads. Is there anyone in the audience who can teach me?
* etc... (Be creative ;) )

We have five rooms for parallel tracks, so you'll probably find a free time slot for your session. If you want to hold a short workshop, you can also take two time slots.

<h3>Session Types</h3>

We expect to have a variety of different session types:

* Group discussions: You set the topic and invite people to come and discuss.
* Hands-on coding: You code together with your audience. It would be helpful if you have a small example on github, which people can clone to get started quickly. Or you try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">Mob Programming</a> on your laptop.
* Interactive Talks: You give a talk (with or without slides) and facilitate a discussion.
* Learning together: When you want to learn about a topic, but don't find an expert who can teach you, spend the time with your audience to learn together.
* Evening sessions: We will also have sessions in the evening in the restaurant. There will not be a projector, but we will have some flip charts and power outlets for laptops.

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<a href="http://connexxo.com/">Pierluigi Pugliese</a> will facilitate the open space for us. In the morning at 08:30, we will kick off with a marketplace where you can propose your sessions and where we decide the schedule together.

We will have a self-service lunch from around 12:00 to around 13:30, but we will also have some parallel sessions. So you decide when you have lunch and if you want to participate in some sessions during lunch time.

At around 17:00 we will head downstairs to the restaurant <a href="http://www.niu.at/">niu</a>, where we will have dinner and the evening sessions.
