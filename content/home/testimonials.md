     &bdquo;SoCraTes was truly great for sharing issues, give and get help! I &sbquo;wrote&rsquo; my first ML algorithm, discussed about ethics, I pushed my boundaries by participating in an improvisation acting workshop, found out about the first computer in Austria and co-hosted a DevOps discussion.&rdquo;

      &bdquo;For me SoCraTes was the best place to share and gain knowledge at the same time. It has never been so easy to find like-minded people with knowledge that were willing to share it and discuss topics that mattered to me and them.&rdquo;

      &bdquo;I thoroughly enjoyed my time at SoCraTes Days Linz, with interesting discussions about e.g. release management and business models unfolding during the day. I usually attend and present at Java technology conferences, so the quite different SoCraTes experience was very welcome. Highly recommended!&rdquo;
