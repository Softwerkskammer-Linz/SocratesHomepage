We are dedicated to create a conference where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a 
good time. We want everybody at our conference to feel safe and welcome. Please help us to do so by 
following some simple rules.

#### Short Version

* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
* Be respectful.
* Be aware of the effect your words may have on others.

<!--more-->
#### Inclusiveness
A primary goal of SoCraTes Day Linz is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most 
varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

#### Safe Environment
As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

And so we invite all those who participate in the SoCraTes Day Linz and the community surrounding the conference 
to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. With your help, this conference can be a great
experience for everyone!

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
* **Be aware of the effect your words may have on others**. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

#### Scope
This code of conduct applies to the SoCraTes Day Linz itself and to all digital spaces that are related to the event, such as the web page and twitter.

Please help us create a safe and friendly environment for everyone by following these simple rules. If we find somebody violating this code of conduct, we may take any action we deem
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

#### Need Help

If you need help, have any further questions or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff
can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.
