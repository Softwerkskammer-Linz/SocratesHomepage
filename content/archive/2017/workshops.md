We will organize four workshops on Friday starting from 2pm until 6pm. 

Every attendee can submit a workshop. We will later have a voting and the four most popular workshops will take place. 
If your workshop gets accepted, you will have to buy a ticket.

To submit a workshop, please send us your proposal (title, abstract, lecturers) to [info@socrates-conference.at](mailto:info@socrates-conference.at).

<h3>Currently submitted workshops</h3>

* **"A guided hands-on tour through Machine Learning and Data Science"** (by Martin Weber, Bernhard Niedermayer): Machine Learning and Data Science are gaining more traction in private enterprises. Revenue forecasting and predictive maintenance are the guiding topics of what is called Retail and Industry 4.0. We will start with some very basic examples and guide the participants to state of the art machine learning approaches. The workshop will also contain hands-on excercises for which we will provide an environment and appropriate data sets to allow everyone to participate.
* **"Scaling Scrum with Lego"** (by Hermann Lacheiner, Maria Muthenthaler): Everybody knows Lego, either from his or her childhood or maybe recently from playing with your children. It might sound a little bit strange, but Lego is also appropriate for experimenting agile methodologies like Scrum or even scaling Scrum with several teams. In this workshop we will experiment with scaling Scrum methodologies and working in teams together, just with Lego bricks, Story Map and Post-Its. In this Workshop we have room for experimenting different estimation techniques and how to scale Scrum. This workshop is not for people who want to lay back and just listen. This workshop is for people who want to get active, work together, even fail and learn from it. The more people the more fun we have in the workshop;)
* **"Dealing with Legacy Code"** (by David Tanzer): We all have to work with legacy code from time to time. And usually, we have to learn to deal with it on the job, in production code. This makes us anxious: What if I change something, and nothing works anymore?  
* **"Code Review of an iOS App"** (by René Pirringer): Let's do a code review of an iOS App that was written in Swift using Test Driven Development. We will investigate the source code and discuss what things are solved in a good way, what can be better, and what parts are ugly. Disclaimer: The App in question was entirely written by René Pirringer. He has never done a code review in his career and wants to learn how this is done and how to write better software.

In this workshop, you can practice working with legacy code, without fear of destroying anything important. You will work on a very bad piece of code and practice different strategies of working with it: Refactor-then-test, test-then-refactor, add feature, refactor-with-tests.

<h3>Schedule</h3>

The workshop day will start on Friday at 1:30pm. After the workshops, we will have a self-service dinner from around 6:30pm and time for evening sessions up until 10pm in the conference venue. There is also enough time for a few pints in the downstairs restaurant.
