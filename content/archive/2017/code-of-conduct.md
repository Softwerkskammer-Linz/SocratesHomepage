We are dedicated to create a conference where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a
good time. And we need your help to achieve that. We expect you to behave according to our Code of 
Conduct - both at the conference and in all discussions around the conference (online and offline).

Please read our full code of conduct before buying a ticket, discussing online and before coming to
the conference. But **please don't feel intimidated by it** - these are simple rules, and they will
make life better for everyone at the conference.

#### Why we have a CoC

We are dedicated to create a conference where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a
good time. This can only work when we are inclusive to the largest number of contributers, and when
we create an environment where everybody feels safe and welcome.

**Yes, we value discussion and disagreement.** And discussions can become heated. But there have to
be some rules, and there has to be a red line.

In this code of conduct, we want to lay out those rules and red lines.

#### CoC Violations

If you think someone has violated our code of conduct - even if you were not directly involved, like
you just overheard a conversation - please:

* Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
* Contact the organizers of SoCraTes Days Austria (See contact details below. At the conference, our phone numbers can also be found on the back of your badge).

But please give people the benefit of doubt. If there is even a slight chance that this was a misunderstanding
(e.g. the person did not speak in their native language, and did not find the right words), try to sort it out
in a friendly, constructive way.

When we hear of a CoC violations, organizers will hear both sides, and then take action we deem appropriate, like:

* Give a warning
* Have a longer talk about our values
* Expel the perpetrator from the conference without a refund (requires two organizers to agree if this was the first offence)
* Call the authorities

#### Safe Environment

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

And so we invite all those who participate in the SoCraTes Day Linz and the community surrounding the conference 
to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. With your help, this conference can be a great
experience for everyone!

* **Treat everyone professionally** Everybody at the conference is a professional in their field. Treat all attendees as equals. Ask before you teach. Do not explain things without being asked - The person you are talking to right now might know more or different things about the topic than you!
* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.** Give people the benefit of doubt. Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
* **Be aware of the effect your words may have on others.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment, and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
* **Be careful with jokes.** We do not tolerate any CoC violations, even if "it was just a joke".
* **Admit when you do not know something.** Encourage others to admit when they do not know something - and never joke about it. We are all here to learn.

#### Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:

* Harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour. Deliberate intimidation and threats.
* Aggressive or sexualized language and content. Unwanted sexual advances.
* Insulting or putting down other participants. Personal or political attacks.
* Publishing or telling others that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
* Well-actuallies: Telling people what they "actually meant to say".
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
